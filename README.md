: In this work, we study the problem faced by the plants due to less water and due overwater. In
these project, we have placed a moisture sensor in the land to identify the humidity in the soil.If the level of
humidity is less then automatic notification comes to the farmer to ON the motor, and If the humidity
reached a particular level then notification comes to OFF the motor.
